I&apos;m a pilgrim, and I&apos;m a stranger:<br />
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night.</p>

	<li>There the glory is ever shining!<br />
		Oh, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;<br />
		Here in this country so dark and dreary,<br />
		I long have wandered forlorn and weary.</li>
	<li>There&apos;s the city to which I journey; <br />
		My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!<br />
		There is no sorrow, nor any sighing, <br />
		Nor any tears there, or any dying.</li>
	<li>Farewell, neighbors, with tears I&apos;ve warned you,<br />
		I must leave you, I must leave you, and be gone!<br />
		With this your portion, your heart&apos;s desire,<br />
		Why will you perish in raging fire?</li>
	<li>Father, mother, and sister, brother!<br />
		If you will not journey with me, I must go!<br />
		Now since your vain hopes you will thus cherish,<br />
		Should I too linger, and with you perish?</li>
	<li>Farewell, drear earth, by sin so blighted,<br />
		In immortal beauty soon you&apos;ll be arrayed;<br />
		He who has formed thee will soon restore thee,<br />
		And then the dread curse shall nevermore be.</li>
